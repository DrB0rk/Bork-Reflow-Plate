## tutorial

1. Download/Clone the repo [here](https://github.com/ElTangas/jtag2updi) and rename the folder "source" to "jtag2updi" (otherwise the Arduino IDE won't open it)

2. Open `jtag2updi/jtag2updi.ino` in your Arduino IDE

3. Configure the flasher options for your Arduino Nano and flash it
```
Board: Arduino nano
Processor: Atmega328p (somtetimes Atmega328p(Old Bootloader) may be needed)

Port: (port of your nano)
``` 

4. Add the MegaCoreX hardware package to the Ardunio IDE (found [here](https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCoreX#how-to-install))

5. Install the Adafruit_GFX, Adafruit_SSD1306 and Debounce2 libraries with the Library Manager (`Sketch > include library > manage libraries`)

6. Download and open the ino in this repo found [here](https://github.com/DrB0rk/Bork-Reflow-Plate/blob/main/Board%20Versions/70mm%20by%2050mm%20Ver3.0%20ATmega4809/Software/SW1.0_HW3.0_70by50mm/SW1.0_HW3.0_70by50mm.ino)

7. Connect ds on the arduino nano to the updi pin on the board through a 4.7k ohm resistor, and connect GND and 5v from the arduino to the board

8. Select the options below

```
Board: Atmega4809
Clock: Internal 16 MHz
BOD: BOD2.6V
EEPROM: EEPROM retained
Pinout: 48 pin standard
Reset pin: reset
Bootloader: No bootloader
port: (select the com port of your nano)

Programmer: Jtag2updi
```

11. upload the sketch using your programmer (`sketch > upload using programmer`)

## About the Project

Like any good nerd does I've been expanding my hobby horizons.
I've gone from breadboard, to perf board, through-hole, to SMD, ever increasing circuit complexity and improving my knowledge.
But I've become frustrated with the difficulty of SMD soldering.
Regular soldering jogs small components and needs lots of flux.
Hot air damages plastics.
Hot plates are expensive and can be big wastes of space.

*"But you're a nerd"* I hear you cry, *"why don't you DIY a solution?"*.

[Electronoobs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjiVhIvGmRZixSzupD0sS9Q) shows a great DIY solution using an old clothes iron hot plate.
You can watch his video [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7blZigaaaA)
Have a go!

While I love this solution, I wanted to develop something smaller and more permanent.
Hence the Solder Reflow Plate was born, a PCB-based, MOSFET controlled heater, perfect for easily reflowing SMD components giving surprisingly professional results. Furthermore, these results are achieved without breaking the bank or taking up an enormous amount of desk space.

And so, this nerd bestows upon the world his project, fully open-source and hackable.
Here's hoping that it may be used to develop skills, build custom circuit boards, and make quality designs possible to all!
